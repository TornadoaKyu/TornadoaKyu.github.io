### Time table
> If you want to plan ahead, I present you the time table. You can either set it up daily, weekly, or even monthly.
> This is an example of a daily time table (this is often used if you lack self control):

| Monday  | Tasks |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 0500-0600  | Me time  |
| 0600-0800  | Physiological needs  |
| 0800-1100  | Science  |
| 1100-1200  | Computer  |
| 1200-1300  | Lunch  |
| 1300-1600  | English  |
| 1600-1800  | MAPEH  |

> Meanwhile this is weekly time table (this needs some self control):

| Time   | Monday  | Tuesday  | Wednesday  | Thursday  | Friday  | Saturday  | Sunday  |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 0500-0600  | Me time  |
