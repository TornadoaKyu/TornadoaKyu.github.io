# **How to be stressed?**

### I am a student so I've got experience. That's why, if you wanna be stressed just listen to everything I say. (^人^)

### 1. Don't do your tasks.
> Doesn't sound stressing, right? Let's see on the day of the deadline.

### 2. Have a "relationship" early.
> Do you think that high school drama is realistic? Ha! In your face! You'll wish you won't have to arrive to school because of that. Well, unless-

### 3. Don't study.
> Good luck on the day of the test!! ヾ(•ω•`)o

### 4. Raise everyone's expectations.
> Don't be too proud now, there there. You might raise others expectations in you. You'll be forced to do your hardest. #guilty

## Conclusion
Make sure you don't get stressed. I love all of the students that's why ***good luck for this school year 2022-2023*** !!
